### A ripoff of Jeopardy by Zak Sandler

#### GETTING STARTED

[Jeo-Party!](https://zsandler.github.io/unit-1-project-Jeo-Party/ "Jeo-Party!") is a simplified and modified version of Jeopardy. In this game, there are 2 teams, 2 dollar amounts ($250 and $400), 4 questions for each dollar amount, and 3 possible answer choices for each question. 

When the game begins, Team 1 selects a question by clicking either "$250" or "$400". The question is displayed in that same box, and three possible answers appear above. If the right answer is clicked, the line turns green, the appropriate point total is delegated to the "Team 1 Total" box, and the turn stays with Team 1. If the wrong answer is clicked, the line turns red, no points are added, and the turn changes to Team 2. To reveal the next question, the player must either click on the box that displayed the question, or on the point value box that remains. For example, if Team 1 picks a $250 question and gets it wrong, Team 2 can either click the question box, or the $400 box.

#### PLANNED FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
I plan to reveal the right answer when a wrong answer is picked, and to make it impossible to choose a second possible answer. I plan to create categories, as in Jeopardy. I also plan to make the clicking a little more intutive, so that the player always clicks a box labeled "$250" or "$400", rather than having to click the question box. Finally, I plan to add 2 more dollar amount options ($750 and $1000), as well as adding 3 more questions per dollar amount, and 4 possible choices for each (instead of 3).
